# Catsüê± vs Dogsüê∂ 
Cats vs Dogs classification using Python Keras API 

This is my very first CNN and deep learning model implemented with Keras Deep Neural Networks API. Hence, I faced many challenges during the development, and overcomed them with hardships.
Overall, I am supper excited to have completed it successfully. There is a long way yet to travel; and this is an excellent start.
